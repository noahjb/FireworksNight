There's a lot more you can do with this foundation behind you. How about adding a score label? Or perhaps adding different fireworks spread types, for example one where fireworks launch from the left and right? Or if you fancy a bigger challenge, how about making the game end after a certain number of launches? You will need to use the invalidate() method of Timer to stop it from repeating.
